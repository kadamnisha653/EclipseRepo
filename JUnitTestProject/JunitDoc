Software Testing
	objective is to find the defects/ bugs.
	
	Defect: variance between actual result and expected result.
	
	For example:
	Gmail.com - Sign in
expected:		if valid username and valid password is entered 
					then user should be successfully signed in.
					
actual: run gmail.com: enter the valid credentials
	Then check if it allows to sign in or is it giving an error message.
	
Lets assume
	actual result: after entering the credentials it allows me to sign in.
	
	actual result = expected result : no defect
	
	Assertion: comparison between expected result and actual result.
